# PythonWordGenerator
This PYTHON script generates 1000 random English words using the NLTK and RANDOM addons. This can be useful when using a spambot (also listed).

# System Requirements:
1. Windows 10 or higher
2. VBS needs to be turned on (if you haven't turned it off yourself and you are on a Windows computer it's probably on)

## Please know that the file links that I listed below are from this GitHub page!

# How to set up?

### If you wanna use a list that is already generated, then just download it from the link below, and if you wanna use it to spam go to the `Run the spambot` article
`https://github.com/djpanther78/PythonWordGeneratorAndSpammer/blob/main/VBS-Spambot.vbs`

### Step 1: Download Python from the link down below
PYTHON (Warning: It's a direct download link from the official python website: `https://python.org`): `https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe`
### Step 2: Download The File(s) from the links down below, it will say that it can harm your device, but I guarantee you that it's completely safe.
1. PYTHON-Wordgenerator: `https://github.com/djpanther78/PythonWordGenerator/blob/main/Python%20Wordgenerator.py`
**If you also wanna use the spambot then download this link:**
2. VBS-Spambot: `https://github.com/djpanther78/PythonWordGenerator/blob/main/VBS-Spambot.vbs`

### Step 3: Run the PYTHON-Wordgenerator
Open the PYTHON-Wordgenerator, there should pop-up a Prompt for ~2 seconds, wait for around another ~2 seconds and there should be a file called: `Wordlist`. You can open it to verify that it has 1000 words in it.

# Run the spambot

### Step 1: Select the file: `Wordlist.txt` and then press CTRL+SHIFT+C
### Step 2: Open the file in your favorite text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, etc.)
### Step 3: Search for: `("PATH WHERE THE WORDLIST IS SAVED")` (You can find it in Rule 2, Sign 34)
### Step 4: Select: `PATH WHERE THE WORDLIST IS SAVED` and press CTRL+V 
### Step 5: Go to the "inputbox" (input box means the field where you wanna spam such as the WhatsApp message type field.
### Step 6: Wait for 0-10 seconds
### Step 7: The spam starts

# Modifications

### 1. You can change the number of words you wanna generate by changing `1000` (Rule 11, Sign 13) to the amount you wish, sadly you can't generate unlimited words. What you can do is generate 2 and combine them together by copy and paste.
## That was 1 form of modification, but you can modify the entire script if you want, if you wanna get help with it scroll all the way down to the bottom of this `README.md` file and you can see the contactoptions
